# Compiler Options \label{chap:compiler_options}

is this chapter required? what should be the content? should not be just a list of compiler options

* RELEASE: optimized with -O3 for execution runs
* DEBUG: debugger options
* SANI: GNU sanitizer for further debugging

It also checks array indices for assumed and deferred shape arrays against the actual allocated bounds and ensures that all string lengths are equal for character array constructors without an explicit typespec.                                         |

Note: This option does not affect explicit allocations using theALLOCATE statement, which will be always checked.                                                                                                                   |

See also -frecursive. Note: This check does not work for OpenMP programs and is disabled if used together with -frecursiveand -fopenmp.                                                                          |

This option is only effective for the compilation of the Fortran main program                                                                                                       |
|           -fstack-arrays           |                      |                                    Adding this option will make the Fortran compiler put all local arrays, even those of unknown size onto stack memory. If your program uses very large local arrays it is possible that you will have to extend your runtime limits for stack memory on some operating systems. This flag is enabled by default at optimization level -Ofast.                                    |
|           -frepack-arrays          |                      | In some circumstances GNU Fortran may pass assumed shape array sections via a descriptor describing a noncontiguous area of memory. This option adds code to the function prologue to repack the data into a contiguous block at runtime.This should result in faster accesses to the array. However it can introduce significant overhead to the function call, especially when the passed data is noncontiguous. |
