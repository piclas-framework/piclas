abstract = {The performance of different types of boundary conditions used in direct simulation Monte Carlo models of subsonic flows for single species flow fields is assessed in this study. An inlet boundary condition that permits the specification of pressure and temperature is investigated, as well as one that permits the specification of mass flow rate and temperature. A new inlet boundary condition is suggested that permits the total mass flow rate to be specified without requiring inter-processor communication during a parallel computation. Two types of outlet boundary conditions are investigated, one in which the outlet pressure is maintained by controlling the porosity of the outlet surface, and another in which particles are introduced at the outlet with properties such that the desired pressure is maintained. Each of the boundary conditions investigated produce flow field results for a single species, microchannel flow that are in good agreement with an analytical solution of the flow field and previously reported results. However, a simulation of a more complicated multi-species flow inside a vapor deposition reactor shows that some of the predicted flow field and surface properties are a function of the type of outlet boundary condition used. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {New treatments of the subsonic constant flow rate boundary and porous outlet boundary used for the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method are proposed. For the constant flow rate boundary, the total number of molecules inserted is calculated using the number of molecules that flow out of the boundary at previous time step, and the molecules inserted over the boundary are distributed according to the local mean flow velocity and number density. For the porous outlet, it is used to simulate the vacuum pump, and the deleting probability is calculated using the number of molecules that impinge on the boundary, the local pressure and the pump speed. Except for the constant flow inlet and porous outlet, the pressure inlet/outlet and the outgassing wall boundaries are implemented in dsmcFoam and verified. The results of different treatments of the boundary are compared with each other, it shows that the new treatment of the constant flow rate boundary can achieve a more accurate flow rate, and the non-uniform distribution of the inserted molecules can decrease the averaging effect at the inlet; the porous outlet can achieve the desired pressure at the outlet when just giving the pump speed, but there is an averaging effect compared with the pressure outlet due to the uniform deleting probability. The results are also compared with that of DS2V when the boundary conditions are available, it shows that the constant pressure boundary can achieve a more accurate pressure in dsmcFoam than in DS2V, and the results of the outgassing wall are almost the same with both solvers.},

abstract = {In molecular simulations of fluid flow, the measurement of mean fluid velocity is considered to be a straightforward computation, yet there is some ambiguity in its definition. We show that in systems far from equilibrium, such as those with large temperature or velocity gradients, two commonly used definitions give slightly different results. Specifically, a bias can arise when computing the mean fluid velocity by measuring the mean particle velocity in a cell and averaging this mean over samples. We show that this bias comes from the correlation of momentum and density fluctuations in non-equilibrium fluids, obtain an analytical expression for predicting it, and discuss what system characteristics (e.g., number of particles per cell, temperature gradients) reduce or magnify the error. The bias has a physical origin so although we demonstrate it by direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) computations, the same effect will be observed with other particle-based simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics and lattice gases. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The current paper investigates the appropriateness and consequences of avoiding successively repeated collisions usually recommended in the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solvers, which use the No Time Counter (NTC) collision technique. A sensitive test case, i.e., Fourier heat transfer problem at the early slip regime, is considered in the presence and absence of the successively repeated collisions. The effects of repeated collisions and avoiding them on different parameters such as heat flux, collision frequency, collision separation distance, accepted-to-selected collisions ratio, and probability distribution functions for the number of collisions and relative velocities of collision pairs are evaluated and discussed. The investigations are performed considering contributions of different computational parameters, i.e., cell sizes, time step, and number of particles. In addition to collision frequency and collision separation distance, which were reported previously as crucial parameters affecting the accuracy of the DSMC solution, we found that the level of repeated collisions also plays a pivotal role in the accuracy of the heat flux prediction in the Fourier problem. We show that direct avoiding of repeated collisions can lead to a distortion of collision probability distribution and consequently, to introduction of a systematic error in collision frequency and predicted heat flux. This error is negligible if one uses a large number of particles per cell, but it is of considerable importance if there are a few particles per cell.},

abstract = {This article shows how to evaluate rotational symmetry numbers for different molecular configurations and how to apply them to transition state theory. In general, the symmetry number is given by the ratio of the reactant and transition state rotational symmetry numbers. However, special care is advised in the evaluation of symmetry numbers in the following situations: (i) if the reaction is symmetric, (ii) if reactants and/or transition states are chiral, (iii) if the reaction has multiple conformers for reactants and/or transition states and, (iv) if there is an internal rotation of part of the molecular system. All these four situations are treated systematically and analyzed in detail in the present article. We also include a large number of examples to clarify some complicated situations, and in the last section we discuss an example involving an achiral diasteroisomer.},

@article{Burt2015b,
abstract = {Numerical procedures based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method are presented for determination of electronic energy distributions and gas emission in non-ionized hypersonic flows, with intended application to shock layer emission analysis for a hypersonic remote sensing platform. The proposed modeling approach enables utilization of experimental state-to-state transition rates, and differs from earlier approaches by nearly eliminating the dependence on excited state populations for statistical scatter in computed energy distributions. Calculations are performed for a simple homogeneous relaxation problem, and for a Mach 10 flow of reacting air around a blunted wedge with a global Knudsen number of 410-4. The latter flow approximately represents leading edge conditions for a hypersonic sensing platform, and results from this simulation are employed to compare gas emission with expected signal intensity along a notional signal path. We find particularly strong emission from freestream species in the region of continuum breakdown around the bow shock, and we estimate that gas emission should have a very small but potentially non-negligible influence on signal reception for a passive sensing system.},

@article{Ruscic2005,
abstract = {Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) are a good example of a significant breakthrough in chemical science that is directly enabled by the US DOE SciDAC initiative. ATcT is a new paradigm of how to obtain accurate, reliable, and internally consistent thermochemistry and overcome the limitations that are intrinsic to the traditional sequential approach to thermochemistry. The availability of high-quality consistent thermochemical values is critical in many areas of chemistry, including the development of realistic predictive models of complex chemical environments such as combustion or the atmosphere, or development and improvement of sophisticated high-fidelity electronic structure computational treatments. As opposed to the traditional sequential evolution of thermochemical values for the chemical species of interest, ATcT utilizes the Thermochemical Network (TN) approach. This approach explicitly exposes the maze of inherent interdependencies normally ignored by the conventional treatment, and allows, inter alia, a statistical analysis of the individual measurements that define the TN. The end result is the extraction of the best possible thermochemistry, based on optimal use of all the currently available knowledge, hence making conventional tabulations of thermochemical values obsolete. Moreover, ATcT offer a number of additional features that are neither present nor possible in the traditional approach. With ATcT, new knowledge can be painlessly propagated through all affected thermochemical values. ATcT also allows hypothesis testing and evaluation, as well as discovery of weak links in the TN. The latter provides pointers to new experimental or theoretical determinations that can most efficiently improve the underlying thermochemical body of knowledge.},

abstract = {The concept behind active thermochemical tables (ATcT) is presented. As opposed to traditional sequential thermochemistry, ATcT provides reliable, accurate, and internally consistent thermochemistry by utilizing the thermochemical network (TN) approach. This involves, inter alia, a statistical analysis of thermochemically relevant determinations that define the TN, made possible by redundancies in the TN, such as competing measurements and alternate network pathways that interrelate the various chemical species. The statistical analysis produces a self-consistent TN, from which the optimal thermochemical values are obtained by simultaneous solution in error-weighted space, thus allowing optimal use of all of the knowledge present in the TN. ATcT offers a number of additional features that are not present nor possible in the traditional approach. With ATcT, new knowledge can be painlessly propagated through all affected thermochemical values. ATcT also allows hypothesis testing and evaluation, as well as discovery of weak links in the TN.
