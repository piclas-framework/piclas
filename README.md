## Documentation and Installation

The documentation of PICLas can be found in the [User Guide](https://piclas.readthedocs.io/), where the installation procedure is
described in [Chapter 2](https://piclas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/installation.html).
Pre-compiled executables (that only require pre-installed MPI for parallel execution) for Linux can directly be downloaded as
AppImage containers from the [PICLas release tag assets](https://github.com/piclas-framework/piclas/releases).

## Regression Testing

An overview of the regression tests used for continuous integration is given in [REGGIE.md](REGGIE.md).
