# About
These scripts help setting up a module environment for development with piclas, which is used via

    module load X

after everything has been installed (CMake, GCC, Open MPI, HDF and possibly ParaView) in the same way a HPC cluster may provide its pre-installed packages to the user.

# Installation

To execute all scripts as super user, run and/or change to the script files directory

    sudo -s
    cd /path/to/piclas/tools

Note that all scripts (5-8) can be re-run with the argument `-r` or `-rerun`.
This cleans the created module file and build directory of the version currently build and rebuilds it.

## 1. Install the basic packages depending on the OS (Ubuntu is assumed here)


    sudo ./InstallPackagesUbuntu16.sh
    sudo ./InstallPackagesUbuntu20.sh
    sudo ./InstallPackagesUbuntu21.sh
    sudo ./InstallPackagesUbuntu22.sh

and if you have a server that has been setup with only basic packages, the following might be required

    sudo ./InstallPackagesServer.sh

## 2. Module Environment from [https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules](https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules)

    sudo ./InstallModules.sh

Make sure to check for the newest version and change the version number within the script. Reboot and maybe second time `./InstallModules.sh` is needed if `module list` does not work and returns `command not found: module`.

## 3. CMake from [https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/)

When installing the module env on a new OS (e.g. Ubuntu 22 in combination with gcc 11.2, then it is advised to install gcc first and load the desired gcc version during the installation of CMake to prevent GLIBCXX_3.4.XX version problems). If an older version of Ubuntu is used in combination with a new gcc version, then continue to install CMake first

    sudo ./InstallCMake.sh

## 4. GCC Compiler from [ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/languages/gcc/releases](ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/languages/gcc/releases)
    sudo ./InstallGCC.sh

## 5. Open MPI from [https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.1/](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.1/)
    sudo ./InstallMPIallCOMPILERS.sh

## 6. HDF5 from [https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/](https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/)
    sudo ./InstallHDF5.sh

## 7. ParaView from [https://www.paraview.org/download/](https://www.paraview.org/download/)
The installation of ParaView is not mandatory for piclas/hopr. The pre-requisites for Ubuntu are installed via

    sudo ./InstallPackagesParaView.sh

and Paraview itself is installed via

    sudo ./InstallParaview.sh

## 8. HOPR from [https://github.com/hopr-framework/hopr](https://github.com/hopr-framework/hopr)
This installation is optional and creates a module for HOPR by running

    sudo ./InstallHOPR.sh

and requires GCC, MPI and HDF5.

## 9. PETSc from [https://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/release-snapshots/](https://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/release-snapshots/)
This installation is optional and creates a module for PETSc by running

    sudo ./InstallPETSc.sh

and requires GCC and MPI.
