# Flow through channel: Testing of a circular inflow
* Constant inflow with a fixed number density
* Circular inflow defined by an inner circle, which is excluded from the surface flux
* Resulting number density in the domain should correspond to the input value multiplied by the area ratio between total surface flux area and the actual area without the circle (roughly 80%)
