# Rotational frame of reference: Wall interaction
* Frame of reference is rotating with a single revolution per second
* A single particle is inserted at (x,y) = (0.25,-0.25) and is expected to "move" on a circular path in the rotating frame of reference due to the fictitious forces
* A wall is rotating with the frame of reference, after a collision, the particle should remain stationary in the rotating frame of reference at (x,y) = (0.25,0.25)
* However, due to the differences between the linear trajectory assumed in the tracking and the calculated circular trajectory, the particle does not stay exactly in that position
