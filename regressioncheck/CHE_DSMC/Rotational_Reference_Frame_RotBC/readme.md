# Rotational frame of reference: Rotational periodic BC
* Frame of reference is rotating with a single revolution per second
* A single particle is inserted at (x,y) = (0.25,0.25) and is expected to "move" on a circular path in the rotating frame of reference due to the fictitious forces
* Rotationally periodic BCs are along (0,1) and (1,0) with a symmetry angle of 90 degree, where particle should complete a complete revolution after a 1/4 second
* Test case: simulation for 0.15 second, particle leaves the domain at the (1,0) and reappears at the (0,1) boundary, still moving on the circle path
