# Rotational frame of reference
* Frame of reference is rotating with a single revolution per second
* A single particle is inserted at (x,y) = (0.25,0.25) and is expected to "move" on a circular path in the rotating frame of reference due to the fictitious forces
* Particle position in x and y should not deviate from the circle even after several revolutions (in this case: 5 3/4)
* Particle position should be at (x,y) = (-0.25,0.25) after the last incomplete revolution (3/4)
