# Flow through channel: Testing of a circular inflow
* Constant inflow with a fixed number density
* Circular inflow defined by a ring
* Resulting number density in the domain should correspond to the input value multiplied by the area ratio between the ring area and the total surface flux area (roughly 59%)
