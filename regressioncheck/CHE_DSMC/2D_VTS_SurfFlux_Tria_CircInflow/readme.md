# 2D: Particle Emission through Surface Flux & Circular Inflow (Channel/Cylinder)
* Testing the surface flux emission routine for 2D, axisymmetric (radial weighting=T/F), linear weighting and variable time step (linear scaling) with the circular inflow feature
* Comparison of PartAnalyze: number density and temperature
* Desired result of DSMC output: constant number density of n=1E21 and all temperatures at T=5000K
* Comparison of DSMCState not possible due to strong fluctuations
