# Electronic relaxation with cross-section data
* Testing a N2 reservoir using
  * Effective cross-section data (Phelps database, www.lxcat.net, retrieved on February 18, 2020)
  * VHS modelling
* Electronic relaxation based on cross-section data read-in from the database
* Each species at n = 2E22 1/m3
* Adapting the constant velocity of the electrons from 20 eV to 400 eV
* Relaxation rates compared with the theoretical results (see Figure in NIG_Reservoir/MCC_BGG_MultiSpec_XSec_Elec), no relaxation is performed
