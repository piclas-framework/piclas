# Photoionization in the volume (circle and honeycomb)
* **Comparing**: the total number of real electrons in the system with an analytical expression
* Particle emission due to photoionization of $`H_{2}`$ in a volume only (no surface emission)
* no deposition, no interpolation 
* comparison of the number of emitted electrons with the analytic solution
* different MPF and number of MPI ranks are tested to yield the same result
* Note: Because the volume is exactly 1 cubic metre, the calculated electron density is exactly the number of real electrons in the system
* Test photoionization via XSec (phIonXSec) with a single line at approx 124 eV (corresponds to a wavelength of 10 nm)
