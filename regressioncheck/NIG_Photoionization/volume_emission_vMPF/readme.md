# Photoionization in the volume with vMPF
- **Comparing**: the total number of real electrons in the system with an analytical expression and particle numbers for different MPFs
* Particle emission due to photoionization of $`H_{2}`$ and $`N_{2}`$ in a volume only (no surface emission)
* no deposition, no interpolation 
* comparison of the number of emitted electrons with the $`N_{2}^{+}`$ ions with a numerical solution
* different MPF and number of MPI ranks are tested to yield the same result
* Note: Because the volume is exactly 1 cubic metre, the calculated density is exactly the number of real particles of each species in the system
* Different MPFs for the electron species trigger different MPFs for the products, but the density is the same
