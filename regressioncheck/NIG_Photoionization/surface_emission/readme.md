# Photoionization: Surface Emission via SEE
* **Comparing**: the total number of real electrons in the system with an analytical expression
* Particle emission due to secondary electron emission from a surface
* no deposition, no interpolation 
* comparison of the number of emitted electrons with the analytic solution
* different MPF and number of MPI ranks are tested to yield the same result
* Note: Because the volume is exactly 1 cubic metre, the calculated electron density is exactly the number of real electrons in the system
