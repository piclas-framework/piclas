# Test for Torque Output
- Boundary conditions for particles that perform a 90 degree periodic and a 45 degree periodic transformation
- Checks if the calculation of torque is correct in a setup with interplane in combination with multi rotationally periodic BCs
- Run different number of MPI ranks (1,4,20) to test single- and multi-node functionality
