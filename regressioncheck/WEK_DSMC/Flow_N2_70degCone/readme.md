# DSMC - Hypersonic flow around a 70° Cone (Axisymmetric)
* Simulation of a hypersonic N2 flow around a 70° blunted cone at M = 20
* Test case based on Allègre, J., Bisch, D., & Lengrand, J. C. (1997). Experimental Rarefied Heat Transfer at Hypersonic Conditions over 70-Degree Blunted Cone. Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 34(6), 724–728. https://doi.org/10.2514/2.3302
* Comparison of the heat flux with a reference surface state file, which was compared to the experimental values from publication mentioned above (first 4 thermocouples)
* The wake of the heat shield was not included due to strong fluctuations and long sampling duration prohibiting the use of the test case as a regression test
* Additionally, properties of impacting particles are sampled and tested: impact energy (trans, rot, vib), angle and number of impacts
* Different types of particle weighting are tested
  * Conventional radial weighting along y-axis
  * Linear weighting along a coordinate axis
  * Linear weighting along a user-defined vector
