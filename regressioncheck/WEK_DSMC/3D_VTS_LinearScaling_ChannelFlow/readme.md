# DSMC - 3D channel flow with linear timestep scaling
* Simulation of a subsonic channel flow with O2
* Testing the linear timestep distribution by comparing the massflow at the inlet (where the timestep is scaled by a factor of 2)
* Comparing the timestep distribution in the DSMCState file
* Reference files are generated with MPF=10
* Inlet: 3.5E-14 kg/s, 1K, Outlet: open
