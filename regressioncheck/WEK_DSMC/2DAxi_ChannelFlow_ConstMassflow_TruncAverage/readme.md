# DSMC - Massflow driven axisymmetric channel flow
* Simulation of a subsonic channel flow with O2
* Testing the adaptive surface flux boundary conditions (Type=4: Inflow, constant mass flow and temperature, Type=2: Outflow with constant pressure)
* Inlet: 1E-10 kg/s, 300K, Outlet: 0.02 Pa, 300K
* Pressure at outlet is overpredicted due to the diffuse wall
* Type = 3 will overpredict the mass flow at the inlet due to the diffuse wall
