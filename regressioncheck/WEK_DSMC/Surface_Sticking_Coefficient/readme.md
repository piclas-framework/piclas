# DSMC - Empirical Sticking Coefficient Model
* Channel flow with two surfaces with a sticking coefficient model
* Surface perpendicular to the flow supposed to reach a sticking coefficient probability of almost 1 (impact angle < 30)
* Surface parallel to the flow: sticking coefficient reduces to 0 as the impact angle is increasing (impact angle = 0 is perpendicular to the surface)
* Utilization of 2 different parameter sets from the species database based on the impact angle
