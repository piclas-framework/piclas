# DSMC - Zero Massflow boundary condition
* Simulation of a subsonic channel flow with O2
* Testing the adaptive surface flux boundary conditions (Type=4: Outflow, zero mass flow, Type=1: Inflow with constant pressure)
* Inlet: 0.5 Pa, 300K, Outlet: m_dot = 0
* Absolute comparison of massflow, which should be close to zero
