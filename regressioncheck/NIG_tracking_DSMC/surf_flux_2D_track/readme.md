# Box/cylinder with 4 mesh cells: Testing of 2D tracking and surface flux
* Constant surface flux with a fixed number density (7.243E19)
* Testing 2D tracking and surface flux parallel to x-axis in 2D axisymmetric simulation
* Output in PartAnalyze.csv of number density through surface flux should correspond to input value
