# PML-2elem
- two zones are defined in hopr, each having 1 element
- one zone is PML and the other is vacuum
- the runs are repeated multiple times as N is chosen at random
- pAdaptionType = 0,1
- the "external" run is deactivated as it requires the functionality of a changing Nloc, which is not implemented yet.
  The polynomial degree must not change over time. Activacte as soon as this feature is implemented.
