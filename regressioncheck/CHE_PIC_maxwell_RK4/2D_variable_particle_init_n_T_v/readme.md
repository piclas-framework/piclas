# 2D Variable Emission Distribution
- Read particle emission initialization info from reggie-linear-rot-symmetry-species-init.h5
  - n, T, vx, vy, vz for different species
  - Transformation to Cartesian coordinates from cylinder coordinates due to the velocity being defined by the function v=v(r,z)
