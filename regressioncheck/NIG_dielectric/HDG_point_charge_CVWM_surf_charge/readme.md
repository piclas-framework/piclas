# Single charged particle in dielectric region
- vacuum is at the top (+z) and the dielectric region is at the bottom (-z)
- exact function 401 for point charge in vacuum near dielectric interface
- shape function deposition
- comparison with analytical solution, which has a singularity at the position of the particle
- single charge particle at z=0.001 m in vacuum (top)
