# Radiative Transfer (3D) - isothermal infinite cylinder
* Testing the two-dimensional axisymmetric tracking routines for radiative energy transfer on hexahedral, non-conforming computational meshes with 1->2 transitions in each direction
* Testing methods to overcome the disadvantages of a Monte Carlo ray tracer
* Comparing the divergence of the radiative heatflux in an infinite cylinder filled with a gas emitting blackbody radiation
