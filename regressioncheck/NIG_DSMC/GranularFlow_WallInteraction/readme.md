# Granular particle colliding with wall
* Granular particles must be treated differently from classical DSMC particles. Unlike classical particles, granular particles are always reflected specularly; however, they can lose energy due to deformation upon impact with the wall. The amount of energy lost is determined by the parameter "Part-Boundary1-DeformEnergyLoss" in parameter.ini.
