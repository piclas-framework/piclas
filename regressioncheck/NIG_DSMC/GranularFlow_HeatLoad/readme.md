# Granular particle test of energy transfer
* Investigation of the energy transfer from gas to a single granular particle with a fix position. This serves as a verification test case from the article "An open source code for two-phase rarefied flows: rarefiedMultiphaseFoam" by Z. Cao et al., published in Computer Physics Communications 276 (2022), Article No. 108339.
* In this specific test case, the temperature ratio between the gas and the granular particle (not specified in the paper) is approximately 2, meaning the gas temperature is half that of the granular particle.
