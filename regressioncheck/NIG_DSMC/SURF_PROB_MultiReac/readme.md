# Probability-based surface reaction modelling
* Initial insertion of H+, H2+, and H3+, surface chemistry leads to either H2 or H
* No collisions between species, specular reflection at the wall (unless ProductAccommodation has been defined or greater 0 per reaction)
* Target number density of H2 and H should not exceed 0.5E21 and 3.5E21 respectively as a result of the surface reactions, while every other species drops to zero
* Comparing number density of H2 and H with reference file (generated at MPF=1E7)
