# Interplane in combination with multi rotationally periodic BCs
- Boundary conditions for particles that perform a 90 degree periodic and a 45 degree periodic transformation
- Checks if the interplane bounds have been determined correctly
- Run different number of MPI ranks (1,2,7,15,25) to test single- and multi-node functionality
- (could be tested in RotPeriodicBCMulti if reggie functionality is extended)
