# Granular particle motion under influence of gravity
* This is a classic example from mechanics where an object is thrown with an initial velocity v_0 = 2 m/s at an angle alpha=45Â° relative to the horizontal.
* Horizontal (x-direction): uniform motion
* Vertical (y-direction): uniformly accelerated motion due to gravitational attraction:
* y(t) = y_0 + v_0y*t - (1/2)gt^2
