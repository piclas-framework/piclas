# Sampling of electronic excitation
* Testing of the cell-local sampling of electronic excitation using ElectronicModel = 3 (cross-section based probability)
* Xenon background gas and initially inserted electrons at 20 eV
* 4 levels around 10 eV excitation threshold
* Comparison of the ExcitationData container in the DSMCState file and performing a conversion with piclas2vtk
