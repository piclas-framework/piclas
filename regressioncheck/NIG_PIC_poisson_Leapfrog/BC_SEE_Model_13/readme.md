# Secondary Electron Emission - Vaughan formula by Villemant2019
* Particle emission using surface flux by defining an emission current of 1A
* Testing the calculation of the yield through the comparison of the SEE current at the surface
  * SEE current divided by the emission current should yield the yield
  * Comparison with the analytical expression using the reference values is shown in yield.png
