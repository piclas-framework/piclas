# Secondary Electron Emission - Power-fit model
* Particle emission using surface flux by defining an emission current of 2A
* Testing the calculation of the yield (through the comparison of the SEE current at the surface) for a power-fit expression a*E^b + c
  * SEE current divided by the emission current should yield the yield
  * Comparison with the analytical expression using the reference values are shown in pic_yield.pdf
