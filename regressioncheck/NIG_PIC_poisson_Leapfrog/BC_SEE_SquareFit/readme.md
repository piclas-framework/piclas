# Secondary Electron Emission - Square-fit model
* Particle emission using surface flux by defining an emission current of 2A
* Testing the calculation of the yield (through the comparison of the SEE current at the surface) for a square-fit expression a*E + b*E^2 + c
  * SEE current divided by the emission current should yield the yield
  * Comparison with the analytical expression using the reference values is shown in yield.png
