# BGK Reservoir - Relaxation of a N2-O2 mixture
* Test the relaxation of a mixture from thermal non-equilibrium with ESBGK (CollModel=1)
* Equal parts of N2 and O2 at different initial temperatures, T_N2 = 10000K and T_O2=1000K
* Comparison with DSMC is shown in Figure_Comparison_DSMC.png (dashed line: ESBGK)
