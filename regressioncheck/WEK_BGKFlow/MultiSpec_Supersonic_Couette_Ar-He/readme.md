# BGK Multispecies - Supersonic Couette flow
* Simulation of 1D supersonic Couette flow: upper (x+) and lower (x-) boundaries with a wall velocity of +/-350 m/s, symmetric boundary conditions in y and z
* Argon and Helium mixture
* Comparison with DSMC given in Figure_Comparison_DSMC.png (note that the y-axis has been used instead of x-axis in these plots)
