# Radiation - Hypersonic flow around a 70° Cone (Axisymmetric) - Radiation pipeline
* Simulation of a the radiation of a hypersonic N2-N flow around a 70° blunted cone
* Read-in of a DSMC-State file to calculate the radiation
* Radiation of N2 and N (bound-bound transitions)
* Comparison of the radiative heat flux with a reference surface state file
