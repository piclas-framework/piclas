# 2D: Cell local inserting (Channel/Cylinder)
* Testing the cell local inserting routine for 2D, axisymmetric (radial weighting=T/F), and variable time step (linear scaling)
* Comparison of PartAnalyze: number density and temperature
* Desired result of DSMC output: constant number density of at n=1E21 and all temperatures at T=5000K
* Comparison of DSMCState not possible due to strong fluctuations
