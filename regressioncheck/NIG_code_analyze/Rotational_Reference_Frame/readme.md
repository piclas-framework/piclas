# Rotational frame of reference
* Frame of reference is rotating with a single revolution per second
* A single particle is inserted at (x,y) = (0.25,0.) and move on a linear path with v=(0.25,0.) in the stationary frame of reference
* Due to the fictitious forces, the particle's trajectory in the rotational reference frame is complex. 
* For this motion there is an analytical solution (https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0005992) with which the simulation is compared.
