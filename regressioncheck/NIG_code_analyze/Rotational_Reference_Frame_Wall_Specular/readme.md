# Rotational frame of reference: Wall interaction
* Frame of reference is rotating with a single revolution per second
* A single particle is inserted at (x,y) = (-0.25,-0.0) and is expected to "move" on a circular path in the rotating frame of reference due to the fictitious forces
* A wall is rotating with the frame of reference, a specular reflection occurs at the wall.
* There is an analytical solution (https://doi.org/10.1119/10.0005992) for the motion of the particle with which the simulation is compared.
