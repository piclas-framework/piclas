# PIC-MCC - Electron beam acceleration and ionization of background gas
* Inserting electrons with a zero velocity and at a low temperature
* Acceleration with a potential difference of 20 kV
* Ionization of background gas through MCC
* ATTENTION: two different meshes are tested
  * 3D cylinder ... with === axial direction in z ===
  * 2D axisymmetric with === axial direction in x ===
* Comparing the number density of the electron and ions in the channel
