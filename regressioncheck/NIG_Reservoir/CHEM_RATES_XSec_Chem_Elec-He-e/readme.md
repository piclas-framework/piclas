# XSec Chemistry: He + e and He + HeIon
* He + e: Ionization (-> HeIon1 + e + e), Electronic Excitation of He (19.82eV and 20.61eV)
* He + HeIon: Elastic and back-scattering cross-sections
* Test the reaction rates using cross-section based chemistry
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution), where ions and electrons have different energy per run to cover the respective energy range
* Note that the input velocity of the ions is calculated based on the reduced mass to get the energy in the centre of mass frame
* Ion energies in eV to compare with are: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000
* Electron energies in eV to compare with are: 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5, 30, 40, 50, 70, 100, 140, 200
* Figure_Verification_Electrons/Ions.png shows the comparison with theoretical rates
