# XSec Chemistry with H3Ion1 (Ionization, Dissociative Exchange, 4 Products)
* Test the reaction rates using cross-section based chemistry
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution)
* Figure_Verification.png shows the comparison with the theoretical rates
* Reference files (as used for the comparison above) were generated with an MPF = 1
