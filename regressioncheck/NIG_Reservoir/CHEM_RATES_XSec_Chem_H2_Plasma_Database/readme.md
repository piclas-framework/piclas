# XSec Plasma Chemistry
* Test the total collision rates using cross-section based collision and chemistry modelling
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution)
* Figure_Verification.png shows the comparison with the theoretical rates
* Separate reaction rates are compared in the following regression test:
  * CHEM_RATES_XSec_Chem_H2-e
  * CHEM_RATES_XSec_Chem_H2-H2Ion1
  * CHEM_RATES_XSec_Chem_H2-H3Ion1
