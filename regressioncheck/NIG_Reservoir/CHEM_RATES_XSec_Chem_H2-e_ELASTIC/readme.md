# XSec Chemistry: H2 + e (ELASTIC)
* Test the total collision rates using cross-section based collision and chemistry modelling
* Actual number of reaction is counted (reactions are not performed)
* The collision energy is varied through the velocity (constant distribution)
* Figure_Verification.jpg shows the comparison with the theoretical rates
* Utilization of an elastic cross-section for the electron collision
  * Electronic, vibrational and reaction cross-section are added to the elastic to compute an effective cross-section
  * Testing the extension of the cross-section data array based on the energy levels of the additional cross-section
