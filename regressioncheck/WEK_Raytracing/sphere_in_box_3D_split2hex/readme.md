# Ray tracing with high-order refinement: Sphere in box, Split to hex mesh
* Half domain of a 3D setup
* Rays at an angle of 26.6Â° (Vector: (/0.5,0,-1/)) to the z-axis
* Elements below z=-5E-5 are refined using RayTracing-NMax = 2
* Comparison of heat flux on the surfaces and energy in the volume (absolute due to statistics)
