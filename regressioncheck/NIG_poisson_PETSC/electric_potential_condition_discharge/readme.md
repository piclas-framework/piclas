# Multi-EPC: 2 grounded cubes with resistances
- particles are randomly inserted and are absorbed at the two EPC boundaries where the are absorbed
- when particles are absorbed at an EPC an electric potential is calculated via U = R*I = R*(-dQ/dt), which is set until the next
time step changes the potential again
- the two EPC boundaries in this testcase have different resistances R = 100 and 20 Ohm
