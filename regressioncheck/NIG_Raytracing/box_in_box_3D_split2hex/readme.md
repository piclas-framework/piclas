# Ray tracing with high-order refinement: Small cube within a bigger cube, Split to hex mesh
* Rays at an angle on a cube
* Elements below z=0 are refined using RayTracing-NMax = 2
* Testing the functionality of write and read-in of raytracing solution using different number of processors
* Comparison of heat flux on the surfaces and energy in the volume (absolute due to statistics)
