# Ray tracing with high-order refinement: Corner in 2D, Split to hex mesh
* Rays at 22.5deg angle on a corner
* Elements below corner edge (z=0) are refined using RayTracing-NMax = 3
* Testing the functionality of write and read-in of raytracing solutin using different number of processors
* Comparison of heat flux on the surfaces and energy in the volume (absolute, due to statistics)
