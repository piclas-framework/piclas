# Case 4a: MCC without ionization at low background pressure
- The static magnetic field introduced in test case 3 is deactivated again
- Elastic collisions, charge exchange and impact excitation reactions are considered and the
  cross-sections are defined in XSec_Database_H_Parodi_Benchmark.h5
- The pressure of the background gas is 3e19 1/m3
