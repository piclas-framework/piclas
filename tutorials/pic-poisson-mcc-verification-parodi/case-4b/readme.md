# Case 4b: MCC without ionization at high prbackground essure
- The static magnetic field introduced in test case 3 is deactivated again
- Elastic collisions, charge exchange and impact excitation reactions are considered and the
  cross-sections are defined in XSec_Database_H_Parodi_Benchmark.h5
- The pressure of the background gas is increased by a factor of 10 to 3e20 1/m3 as compared
  with test case 4a
