# Two Stream Instability(PIC, Poisson's Equation)

The setup considers a the one-dimensional (1D) case of the two-stream instability using PICLas.
The two-stream instability is a key phenomenon in plasma physics, occurring when two interpenetrating streams of charged particles, such as electrons and/or ions, travel with different (opposite) velocities. This relative motion induces perturbations that grow exponentially, leading to the amplification of plasma waves and potentially resulting in turbulence.

 In PICLas, it can be simulated with the Poisson solver. This setup simulates two electron streams moving with opposite velocities $\nu_{1}$=$-\nu_{2}$ of identical densities $n_{1}$=$n_{2}$ interacting with each other, leading to an instability that generates a fluctuating electric field. The particle distribution at the end of the simulation results in an eye-like structure. 

Before beginning the tutorial, copy the `pic-two-stream-instability` directory from the tutorial folder in the top level
directory to a separate location

    cp -r $PICLAS_PATH/tutorials/pic-two-stream-instability .
    cd pic-two-stream-instability

## Mesh Generation with HOPR (pre-processing)

Before the actual simulation is conducted, a mesh file in the correct HDF5 format has to be supplied.
The mesh files used by **piclas** are created by supplying an input file *hopr.ini* with the required information for a mesh that
has either been created by an external mesh generator or directly from block-structured information in the hopr.ini file itself.
Here, a block-structured grid is created directly from the information in the hopr.ini file.
To create the .h5 mesh file, simply run

    hopr hopr.ini

This creates the mesh file *two_stream_instability_mesh.h5* in HDF5 format.
Alternatively, if you do not want to run **hopr** yourself, you can also use the provided mesh.

The size of the simulation domain is set to [$4\pi\times0.03\times0.03$] m$^{3}$ and is defined by the single block information
in the line, where each node of the hexahedral element is defined

    Corner         =   (/0.,0.,0.,,12.566370614359,0.,0.,,12.566370614359,0.03,0.,,0.,0.03,0.,,0.,0.,0.03,,12.566370614359,0.,0.03,,12.566370614359,0.03,0.03,,0.,0.03,0.03/)

The number of mesh elements for the block in each direction can be adjusted by changing the line

    nElems         = (/801,1,1/)                ! number of elements in each direction (x,y,z)

Each side of the block has to be assigned a boundary index, which corresponds to the boundaries defined in the next steps

    BCIndex        = (/5,3,2,4,1,6/)

The field boundaries can directly be defined in the hopr.ini file (contrary to the particle boundary conditions, which are defined
in the parameter.ini).
Periodic boundaries always have to be defined in the hopr.ini.

    !=============================================================================== !
    ! BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
    !=============================================================================== !
    BoundaryName = BC_periodicx+ ! Periodic (+vv1)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,1/)   ! Periodic (+vv1)
    BoundaryName = BC_periodicx- ! Periodic (-vv1)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,-1/)  ! Periodic (-vv1)
    BoundaryName = BC_periodicy+ ! Periodic (+vv2)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,2/)   ! Periodic (+vv2)
    BoundaryName = BC_periodicy- ! Periodic (-vv2)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,-2/)  ! Periodic (-vv2)
    BoundaryName = BC_periodicz+ ! Periodic (+vv3)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,3/)   ! Periodic (+vv3)
    BoundaryName = BC_periodicz- ! Periodic (-vv3)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,-3/)  ! Periodic (-vv3)

    VV = (/12.566370614359 , 0.  , 0./)    ! Displacement vector 1 (x-direction)
    VV = (/0.     , 0.03 , 0./)            ! Displacement vector 2 (y-direction)
    VV = (/0.     , 0.  , 0.03/)           ! Displacement vector 3 (z-direction)

In this case a fully periodic setup is chosen by defining periodic boundaries on all six sides of the block, reflecting each
positive and negative Cartesian coordinate. In x-direction,

    BoundaryName = BC_periodicx+ ! Periodic (+vv1)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,1/)   ! Periodic (+vv1)
    BoundaryName = BC_periodicx- ! Periodic (-vv1)
    BoundaryType = (/1,0,0,-1/)  ! Periodic (-vv1)

where for each of the six boundaries, a name `BoundaryName` and a type `BoundaryType` must be defined (in this order).
The boundary name can be chosen by the user and will be used again in the parameter.ini.
The first "1" in `BoundaryType` corresponds to the type "periodic" and the last entry, here, either "1" or "-1" corresponds to the
first periodic vector that is defined via `VV=(/12.566370614359 , 0.  , 0./)` that handles periodicity in the x-direction and gives the
orientation on the boundary for the vector. Note that each periodic boundary must have one positive and one negative corresponding
boundary for the same periodic vector.



## PIC Simulation with PICLas

Install **piclas** by compiling the source code as described in Chapter {ref}`userguide/installation:Installation`, specifically
described under Section {ref}`userguide/installation:Compiling the code`.
Always build the code in a separate directory located in the piclas top level directory.
For this PIC tutorial, e.g., create a directory *build_poisson_Leapfrog* by running

    cd $PICLAS_PATH

where the variable `PICLAS_PATH` contains the path to the location of the piclas repository.
If the piclas repository is located in the home directory, runlasma Wave 

    cd /home/$(whoami)/piclas

and the create the build directory, in which the compilation process will take place

    mkdir build_poisson_Leapfrog

and the directory structure, which can be viewed via

    ls -l

should look like this

     build_poisson_RK3
     cmake
     CMakeListsLib.txt
     CMakeListsMachine.txt
     CMakeLists.txt
     CONTRIBUTORS.md
     docs
     LICENCE.md
     README.md
     REFERENCE.md
     REGGIE.md
     regressioncheck
     share
     SpeciesDatabase.h5
     src
     tools
     tutorials
     unitTests

Always compile the code within the *build* directory, hence, navigate to the *build_poisson_Leapfrog* directory before running cmake

    cd build_poisson_Leapfrog

For this specific tutorial, make sure to set the correct compile flags

    PICLAS_EQNSYSNAME     = poisson
    LIBS_USE_PETSC          = ON
    PICLAS_TIMEDISCMETHOD = Leapfrog


using the ccmake (gui for cmake) or simply run the following command from inside the *build* directory

    cmake ../ -DLIBS_USE_PETSC=0N -DPICLAS_EQNSYSNAME=poisson -DPICLAS_TIMEDISCMETHOD=Leapfrog

to configure the build process and run

    make -j

afterwards to compile the executable. For this setup, we have chosen the Poisson solver
and selected the Leapfrog time discretization method. An overview over the available solver
and discretization options is given in Section {ref}`sec:solver-settings`.
To run the simulation and analyse the results, the *piclas* and *piclas2vtk* executables have to be run.
To avoid having to use the entire file path, you can either set aliases for both, copy them to your local tutorial directory or
create a link to the files via

    ln -s $PICLAS_PATH/build_poisson_Leapfrog/bin/piclas
    ln -s $PICLAS_PATH/build_poisson_Leapfrog/bin/piclas2vtk

where the variable `PICLAS_PATH` contains the path to the location of the piclas repository.
If the piclas repository is located in the home directory, the two commands

    ln -s /home/$(whoami)/piclas/build_poisson_Leapfrog/bin/piclas
    ln -s /home/$(whoami)/piclas/build_poisson_Leapfrog/bin/piclas2vtk

can be executed.

Please check where piclas is located before running the commands.

The simulation setup is defined in *parameter.ini*.The process corresponds to a transfer of initial velocities, which equals to a transversal velocity $\nu_{tr,x}(t=0)=\nu_{1}(t=0)$, into a thermal velocity $\nu_{th,x}$. The transversal velocity in x-direction is computed as

$$\nu_{tr,x}={\frac{1}{N_{Parts}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{Parts}}\nu_{x,i}}~,$$

which is used to compute the thermal velocity in x-direction as 

$$\nu_{th,x}={\frac{1}{N_{Part}-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{Parts}}(\nu_{x,i}-\nu_{tr,x})Â²}~.$$


The initial velocity $\nu_{tr,x}$ is computed as 

$$\nu_{tr,x}={}\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\omega_{p}~$$




<!-- For a specific electron number density, the plasma frequency of the system is

$$\omega_{p}=\nu_{e}=\sqrt{\frac{e^{2}n_{e}}{\varepsilon_{0}m_{e}}}~,$$

which is the frequency with which the charge density of the electrons oscillates, where
$\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of vacuum, $e$ is the elementary charge, $n_{e}$ and $m_{e}$
are the electron density and mass, respectively.
For the standard PIC method, the plasma frequency yields the smallest time step that has to be resolved numerically. The
Debye length

$$\lambda_{D}=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{0}k_{B}T_{e}}{e^{2}n_{e}}}~,$$

where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of vacuum, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $e$ is the
elementary charge and $T_{e}$ and $n_{e}$ are the electron temperature and density, respectively, gives a spatial resolution
constraint. In this test case, however, the electron temperature is not the defining factor for the spatial resolution because of the 1D nature
of the setup. Therefore, the resolution that is required is dictated by the gradient of the electric potential solution, i.e., the
electric field, which accelerates the charged particles and must be adequately resolved.
The restriction on the spatial resolution is simply the number of elements (and polynomial degree $N$) that are required to resolve
the physical properties of the PIC simulation. If the temporal and spatial constraints are violated, the simulation will not yield
physical results and might even result in a termination of the simulation.

### General numerical setup

The general numerical parameters (defined in the parameter.ini) are selected by the following

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! DISCRETIZATION
    ! =============================================================================== !
    N             = 2  ! Polynomial degree of the DG method (field solver)

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! MESH
    ! =============================================================================== !
    MeshFile      = two_stream_instability_mesh.h5 ! Relative path to the mesh .h5 file

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! General
    ! =============================================================================== !
    ProjectName       = two_stream_instability ! Project name that is used for naming state files
    ColoredOutput     = F           ! Turn ANSI terminal colors ON/OFF
    doPrintStatusLine = T           ! Output live of ETA
    TrackingMethod    = TriaTracking

where, among others, the polynomial degree $N$, the path to the mesh file `MeshFile`, project name and the option to print the ETA
to the terminal output in each time step.

The temporal parameters of the simulation are controlled via

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! CALCULATION
    ! =============================================================================== !
    ManualTimeStep  = 1e-10 ! Fixed pre-defined time step only when using the Poisson solver. Maxwell solver calculates dt that considers the CFL criterion
    tend            = 1e-6  ! Final simulation time
    Analyze_dt      = 1E-8  ! decrease analyze_dt for better resolution of fish eye
    IterDisplayStep = 1000    ! Number of iterations between terminal output showing the current time step iteration

where the time step for the field and particle solver is set via `ManualTimeStep`, the final simulation time `tend`, the time
between restart/checkpoint file output `Analyze_dt` (also the output time for specific analysis functions) and the number of time
step iterations `IterDisplayStep` between information output regarding the current status of the simulation that is written to std.out.
The remaining parameters are selected for the field and particle solver as well as run-time analysis.

### Boundary conditions

As there are no walls present in the setup, all boundaries are set as periodic boundary conditions for the field as well as the
particle solver. The particle boundary conditions are set by the following lines

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! PARTICLE Boundary Conditions
    ! =============================================================================== !
    Part-nBounds              = 6             ! Number of particle boundaries
    Part-Boundary1-SourceName = BC_periodicx+ ! Name of 1st particle BC
    Part-Boundary1-Condition  = periodic      ! Type of 1st particle BC
    Part-Boundary2-SourceName = BC_periodicx- ! ...
    Part-Boundary2-Condition  = periodic      ! ...
    Part-Boundary3-SourceName = BC_periodicy+ ! ...
    Part-Boundary3-Condition  = periodic      ! ...
    Part-Boundary4-SourceName = BC_periodicy- ! ...
    Part-Boundary4-Condition  = periodic      ! ...
    Part-Boundary5-SourceName = BC_periodicz+ ! ...
    Part-Boundary5-Condition  = periodic      ! ...
    Part-Boundary6-SourceName = BC_periodicz- ! ...
    Part-Boundary6-Condition  = periodic      ! ...

    Part-nPeriodicVectors = 3 ! Number of periodic boundary (particle and field) vectors

    Part-FIBGMdeltas = (/12.56637061435917295 , 0.03 , 0.03/) ! Cartesian background mesh (bounding box around the complete simulation domain)
    Part-FactorFIBGM = (/801., 1. , 1./)   ! Division factor that is applied t the "Part-FIBGMdeltas" values to define the dx, dy and dz distances of the Cartesian background mesh

where, the number of boundaries `Part-nBounds` (6 in 3D cuboid) is followed by the names of
the boundaries (given by the hopr.ini file) and the type `periodic`. Furthermore, the periodic vectors must be supplied and the size
of the Cartesian background mesh `Part-FIBGMdeltas`, which can be accompanied by a division factor (i.e. number of background cells)
in each direction given by `Part-FactorFIBGM`. Here, the size and number of cells of the background mesh correspond to the actual mesh.

### Field solver

The settings for the field solver (HDGSEM) are given by

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! Field Solver: HDGSEM
    ! =============================================================================== !
    IniExactFunc          = 0    ! Initial field condition. 0: zero solution vector
    PrecondType           = 10   ! Direct numerical method

For this tutroial we use a PETSc Solver where a multitude of different numerical methods to solve the resulting system of linear equations is given by the implemented PETSc library and the `PrecondType` is set to 10, `IniExactFunc` sets the initial solution of the field solver (here 0 says that nothing is selected).
The numerical scheme for tracking the movement of all particles throughout the simulation domain can be switched by

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! Particle Solver
    ! =============================================================================== !
    TrackingMethod    = TriaTracking  ! Particle tracking method

The PIC parameters for interpolation (of electric fields to the particle positions) and deposition (mapping of charge properties
from particle locations to the grid) are selected via

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! PIC: Interpolation/Deposition
    ! =============================================================================== !
    PIC-DoInterpolation      = T                   ! Activate Lorentz forces acting on charged particles
    PIC-Interpolation-Type   = particle_position   ! Field interpolation method for Lorentz force calculation

    PIC-Deposition-Type      = cell_volweight_mean ! Linear deposition method
   


where the interpolation type `PIC-Interpolation-Type = particle_position` is currently the only option for specifying how
electro(-magnetic) fields are interpolated to the position of the charged particles.
For charge and current deposition, 
`PIC-Deposition-Type = cell_volweight_mean` is selected.
The different available deposition types are described in more detail in Section {ref}`sec:PIC-deposition`.

### Particle solver

For the treatment of particles, the maximum number of particles `Part-maxParticleNumber` that each processor can hold has to be supplied and
the number of particle species `Part-nSpecies` that are used in the simulation (created initially or during the simulation time
through chemical reactions).

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! PARTICLE Emission
    ! =============================================================================== !
    Part-nSpecies             = 3    ! Number of particle species

The inserting (sometimes labelled emission or initialization) of particles at the beginning or during the course of the simulation
is controlled via the following parameter. Here, only
the parameters for the electrons are shown, however, the parameters for the ions are set analogously and included in the supplied parameter.ini.
For each species, the mass (`Part-SpeciesX-MassIC`), charge (`Part-SpeciesX-ChargeIC`) and weighting factor (`Part-SpeciesX-MacroParticleFactor`)
have to be defined.

    ! -------------------------------------
    ! Electrons 1
    ! -------------------------------------
    Part-Species1-ChargeIC            = -1.60217653E-19 ! Electric charge of species #1
    Part-Species1-MassIC              = 9.1093826E-31   ! Rest mass of species #1
    Part-Species1-MacroParticleFactor = 2.4e5           ! Weighting factor for species #1
    Part-Species1-nInits              = 1               ! Number of initialization/emission regions for species #1

The number of initialization sets is defined by `Part-Species1-nInits`, where each initialization set is accompanied
by a block of parameters that starts from `Part-Species1-Init1-SpaceIC` up to `Part-Species1-Init1-VeloVecIC` and are preceded by the
corresponding `-InitX` counter. In this example we have a single initialization set per species definition.
The `Part-Species1-Init1-SpaceIC =  sin_deviation` flag defines the type of the initialization set, here, the distribution the particles
equidistantly on a line and sinusoidally dislocates them (representing an initial stage of a plasma wave in 1D).
Each type of the initialization set might have a different set of parameters and an overview is given in Section
{ref}`sec:particle-initialization-and-emission`.


    Part-Species1-Init1-ParticleNumber        = 100000           ! Number of simulation particles for species #1 and initialization #1
    Part-Species1-Init1-maxParticleNumber-x   = 100000           ! Number of simulation particles in x-direction for species #1 and initialization #1
    Part-Species1-Init1-SpaceIC               = sin_deviation    ! Sinusoidal distribution is space
    Part-Species1-Init1-BasePointIC           = (/0.0 , 0.015 , 0.015/)
    Part-Species1-Init1-velocityDistribution  = constant         ! Constant velocity distribution
    Part-Species1-Init1-maxParticleNumber-y   = 1                ! Number of particles in y
    Part-Species1-Init1-maxParticleNumber-z   = 1                ! Number of particles in z
    Part-Species1-Init1-MWTemperatureIC       = 0.72429730341e23 
    Part-Species1-Init1-Amplitude             = 0.004            ! Specific factor for the sinusoidal distribution is space
    Part-Species1-Init1-WaveNumber            = 0.5              ! Specific factor for the sinusoidal distribution is space
    Part-Species1-Init1-VeloIC                = 1.06e8           ! Velocity magnitude [m/s]
    Part-Species1-Init1-VeloVecIC             = (/1.,0.001,0.001/)  ! Normalized velocity vector



The extent of dislocation is controlled by `Part-Species1-Init1-Amplitude`, which is only set for the electron species as the ion
species is not dislocated (they remain equidistantly distributed).
The parameter `Part-Species1-Init1-WaveNumber` sets the number of sine wave repetitions in the `x`-direction of the domain.
In case of the `SpaceIC=sin_deviation`, the number of simulation particles must be equal to the multiplied values given in
`Part-Species1-Init1-maxParticleNumber-x/y/z` as this emission type allows distributing the particles not only in one, but in all
three Cartesian coordinates, which is not required for this 1D example.

In the same manner, a second stream of electron is defined with  only the  difference of `Part-Species2-Init1-VeloVecIC` = (/-1.,0.001,0.001/) and `Part-Species2-Init1-Amplitude` = -0.004  

The ions at rest in the background are defined as well providing a quasi-neutral state. 

    ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
    ! Ions 3
    ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- !
    Part-Species3-ChargeIC                     = 3.204e-19
    Part-Species3-MassIC                       = 6.69e-27
    Part-Species3-MacroParticleFactor          = 2.4e5            ! Weighting factor for species #3
    Part-Species3-nInits                       = 1
    !Part-Species3-Init1-maxParticleNumber-x   = 100000           ! Number of simulation particles in x-direction for species 3
    Part-Species3-Init1-maxParticleNumber-y    = 1                ! Number of particles in y
    Part-Species3-Init1-maxParticleNumber-z    = 1                ! Number of particles in z
    Part-Species3-Init1-SpaceIC                = sin_deviation
    Part-Species3-Init1-BasePointIC            = (/0.0 , 0.015 ,0.015/)
    Part-Species3-Init1-velocityDistribution   = constant
    Part-Species3-Init1-VeloIC                 = 0.0
    Part-Species3-Init1-VeloVecIC              = (/0.,0.,0./)
    Part-Species3-Init1-Amplitude              = 0.0             ! Specific factor for the sinusoidal distribution is space
    Part-Species3-Init1-WaveNumber             = 0.              ! Specific factor for the sinusoidal distribution is space

### Analysis setup

Finally, some parameters for run-time analysis are chosen by setting them `T` (true). Further, with `TimeStampLength = 13`, the names of the output files are shortened for better postprocessing. If this is not done, e.g. Paraview does not sort the files correctly and will display faulty behaviour over time.

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! Analysis
    ! =============================================================================== !
    TimeStampLength         = 13 ! Reduces the length of the timestamps in filenames for better postprocessing
    CalcCharge               = T ! writes rel/abs charge error to PartAnalyze.csv
    CalcPotentialEnergy      = T ! writes the potential field energy to FieldAnalyze.csv
    CalcKineticEnergy        = T ! writes the kinetic energy of all particle species to PartAnalyze.csv
    PIC-OutputSource         = T ! writes the deposited charge (RHS of Poisson's equation to XXX_State_000.0000XXX.h5)
    CalcPICTimeStep          = T ! writes the PIC time step restriction to XXX_State_000.0000XXX.h5 (rule of thumb)
    CalcPointsPerDebyeLength = T ! writes the PIC grid step restriction to XXX_State_000.0000XXX.h5 (rule of thumb)
    CalcTotalEnergy          = T ! writes the total energy of the system to PartAnalyze.csv (field and particle)
    CalcInternalEnergy       = T
    CalcTemp                 = T
    CalcVelos                = T
    Part-LorentzType         = 3
    CalcTimeAverage          = T
    CalcPlasmaParameter      =T
    VarNameAvg               = ChargeDensity-Spec01
    VarNameAvg               = ChargeDensity-Spec02
    VarNameAvg               = ChargeDensity-Spec03

The function of each parameter is given in the code comments. Information regarding every parameter can be obtained from
running the command

    piclas --help "CalcCharge"

where each parameter is simply supplied to the *help* module of **piclas**. This help module can also output the complete set of
parameters via `piclas --help` or a subset of them by supplying a section, e.g., `piclas --help "HDG"` for the HDGSEM solver.

### Running the code

The command

    ./piclas parameter.ini | tee std.out

executes the code and dumps all output into the file *std.out*.
To reduce the computation time, the simulation can be run using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) on multiple cores, in this case 8

    mpirun -np 8 piclas parameter.ini | tee std.out

If the run has completed successfully, which should take only a brief moment, the contents of the working folder should look like

Multiple additional files have been created, which are are named  **Projectname_State_Timestamp.h5**.
They contain the solution vector of the equation system variables at each interpolation nodes at the given time, which corresponds
to multiples of **Analyze_dt**. If these files are not present, something went wrong during the execution of **piclas**.
In that case, check the `std.out` file for an error message.

After a successful completion, the last lines in this file should look as shown below:

## Visualization (post-processing)

To visualize the solution, the *State*-files must be converted into a format suitable for **ParaView**, **VisIt** or any other
visualisation tool for which the program **piclas2vtk** is used.

The parameters for **piclas2vtk** are stored in the **parameter.ini** file under

    ! =============================================================================== !
    ! piclas2vtk
    ! =============================================================================== !
    NVisu         = 6! Polynomial degree used for the visualization when the .h5 file is converted to .vtu/.vtk format. Should be at least N+1
    VisuParticles = T  ! Activate the conversion of particles from .h5 to .vtu/.vtk format. Particles will be displayed as a point cloud with properties, such as velocity, species ID, etc.

where `NVisu` is the polynomial visualization degree on which the field solution is interpolated.
Depending on the used polynomial degree `N` and subsequently the degree of visualization `NVisu`, which should always be higher than
`N`, the resulting electric potential $\Phi$ and its derivative, the electric field strength **E** might show signs of oscillations.
Additionally, the flag `VisuParticles` activates the output of particle position, velocity and species to the *vtk*-files.

Run the command

    ./piclas2vtk parameter.ini plasma_wave_State_000.000000*

to generate the corresponding *vtk*-files, which can then be loaded into the visualisation tool.

The thermal and drift velocity plots can be viewed, for e.g. in **ParaView**, by opening `PartAnalyze.csv` in the **Line Chart View** . The graphs should look like the following

To visualize the probability distribution function, a PDF script present in the tools folder: `piclas/tools/paraview/pdf/511` is to be loaded in Paraview. This can be done by selecting **Tools &rarr; Manage Plugins &rarr; Load New &rarr; pdf_paraview511.xml**. After loading the script, make sure to select the Auto Load feature in the list of plugins for the PDF to avoid loading the script everytime you open Paraview. Open the particle file, e.g., two_stream_instability_visuPart_000.000000000.vtu and add the `Probability Distribution Function 5.11 (piclas)` feature to this file. You can do this by the searching the feature directly in paraview with the shortcut keys `CTRL+SPACE`. Do not forget to set the `xMax`to 12.566, i.e $4\pi$ in our case setup.
