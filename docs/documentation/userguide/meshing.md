# Mesh Generation

**PICLas** utilizes computational meshes from the high order preprocessor **HOPR** in the HDF5 format.
It is available under GPLv3 at [https://github.com/hopr-framework/hopr](https://github.com/hopr-framework/hopr) and is included as part of the PICLas installation.
To compile HOPR together with PICLas, you can set the following CMake variable in the CMake GUI:

    LIBS_BUILD_HOPR         ON

or add the following variable to the console command:

    cmake -DPICLAS_TIMEDISCMETHOD=DSMC -DLIBS_BUILD_HOPR=ON ..

The source code will be downloaded and built automatically, afterwards the executable `hopr` will be placed in the `build/bin/` folder next to the other executables.
If you would like to install HOPR directly from the repository by yourself (e.g. if you would like to join the development),
please refer to the [HOPR documentation](https://hopr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The design philosophy is that all tasks related to mesh organization, different input formats and the construction of high order
geometrical mappings are separated from the *parallel* simulation code. These tasks are implemented most efficiently in a *serial*
environment.
The employed mesh format is designed to make the parallel read-in process as simple and fast as possible.
For details concerning the mesh format please refer to the
[HOPR HDF5 Curved Mesh Format Documentation](https://www.hopr-project.org/upload/e/e6/MeshFormat.pdf).

The basic command for either mesh generation or conversion of an external mesh is

~~~~~~~
hopr hopr.ini
~~~~~~~

Note that the path to the **HOPR** executable, which depends on whether HOPR was installed together with PICLas or separately, is omitted in the command. For the former, the path set in Section {ref}`sec:directory-paths` for PICLas applies for the HOPR executable as well.


## Mesh generation with HOPR

Using **HOPR**, simple, structured meshes can be directly created using an
[in-built mesh generator](https://www.hopr-project.org/index.php/Inbuilt_Mesh_Generators).
A number of strategies to create curved boundaries are also included in HOPR.

## Mesh conversion with HOPR

More complex geometries can be treated by importing meshes generated by external mesh generators in CGNS or GMSH format
([Example parameter file](https://www.hopr-project.org/index.php/External_Meshes)).
Detailed instructions for some mesh generators that we have experience with (Gmsh, Coreform Cubit, OMNIS/HEXPRESS, GridPro, CENTAUR, MeshGems within SALOME) are given below.

### Mesh generation with Gmsh

[Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) is an open-source mesh generator with a built-in CAD engine. As of Gmsh 4.11.0 (October 2022), meshes can be exported in the `.msh` format. For the mesh conversion with HOPR, it is required to enable the option `Save all elements` and chose the ASCII code for the file export. The mesh file can be converted with HOPR, using the corresponding mode:
    
    Mode = 5

Tetrahedral or mixed meshes are created by default. Hexahedral meshes can be generated directly in gmsh by using the subdivision algorithm or by using the following option in HOPR for a tetrahedral mesh:

    SplitToHex = TRUE

Boundary conditions have to be defined as physical groups. A tutorial for the mesh generation with gmsh can be found in the tutorial {ref}`sec:tutorial-dsmc-cone-3D-gmsh`, which requires hopr version v.1.1.0 or newer.

### Mesh generation with Coreform Cubit

As of Coreform Cubit 2021.2 (November 2021), the CGNS export is not implemented for unstructured meshes. The Gambit file format can be utilized instead. Boundary conditions have to be defined as side sets first with the names as they will be used in the simulation. After the side set definitions, additional CFD BCs have to be mapped to the side sets (type is irrelevant, no name required: `System-assigned ID`). The exported Gambit file (`*.neu`) can be converted with HOPR, using the corresponding mode:

    Mode = 2

### Mesh generation with OMNIS/HEXPRESS

As of OMNIS Version 5.2 (November 2021), the CGNS export is not suitable for boundaries with more than one surface (even if they have been grouped together correctly in OMNIS). Instead, the mesh should be exported in the `.sph` format. The following script can be utilized to merge the surfaces

    ####################################################
    # Script to merge surfaces and CGNS export
    ####################################################
    # Make sure to insert the correct file name
    READMESH merge.sph
    # First, all surfaces within "WALL_IN_OMNIS" BC (as defined in OMNIS) are summarized under the new BC "BC_WALL" (the name to use in HOPR)
    UNITESELECTIONS BC_WALL 1 WALL_IN_OMNIS*
    # Second, the original BC group and its surfaces should be deleted. These two commands can be repeated for multiple boundary conditions within a single script.
    DELETESELECTION WALL_IN_OMNIS*
    # Export the mesh as CGNS for the conversion with HOPR
    WRITEMESH mesh.cgns
    END

The above script can be saved in a text file (e.g. `omnis_mergeBCs.conf`) and executed using the datamapper tool

    hexpressdatamapper101 omnis_mergeBCs.conf

The resulting CGNS file can be converted with HOPR, using the corresponding mode:

    Mode = 3

### Mesh generation with GridPro

[GridPro](https://www.gridpro.com/) is a proprietary conforming multi-block mesh generator with hexahedral elements. However,
a free academic version limited to 250 blocks is available.

After mesh generation, and before naming the boundaries in the *Property Setter*, you should set the output format to STARCD.
Make sure to define not only labels but also different properties for the boundaries. Then export as STARCD and you will get
four output files. During the export GridPro loses the label information, thus the boundary names have to be set again in the
*.inp file. An example of a correct *.inp is given below:

    TITLE
    Converted from GridPro v4.1
    CTAB 1 FLUI
    CTNA 1 ZONE_VOL
    RDEF 1 WALL $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
    RNAM 1 BC_WALL
    RDEF 2 CYCL $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
    RNAM 2 BC_CYCL
    VREAD,/home/user/mesh/test.vrt,,1,43770,CODE
    CREAD,/home/user/mesh/test.cel,,1,21504,MODI,CODE
    BREAD,/home/user/mesh/test.bnd,,1,43768,MODI,CODE

HOPR can then read-in the mesh with following mode option:

    Mode = 4

More recent versions of GridPro also support a CGNS output. Here, the option *Export* -> *Grid* -> *CGNS* -> *Elementary* should
be chosen. For different boundary labels, different property types have to be defined (Note: The property type *Wall* might be
causing problems during the HOPR read-in and should be avoided). The following errors can be ignored as long as HOPR finishes
successfully and a mesh file is written out

    ERROR: number of zones in inifile does not correspond to number of zones in meshfile(s)
    ERROR - Could not find corresponding boundary definition of ws.Interblck

### Mesh generation with CENTAUR

A conventional tetrahedral mesh can be generated with CENTAUR. Boundaries have to be set in CENTAUR and accordingly in the HOPR
parameter file. During the export as CGNS the following options are required:

* Check "Only write out boundary faces"
* Check "Write out boundary faces grouped by panels"

Read-in and convert with HOPR using the following options:

    Mode = 3
    BugFix_ANSA_CGNS = TRUE
    SplitToHex = TRUE

Should problems occur, try to set SpaceQuandt to a higher value, e.g. 100. During the pre-processing step, every tetrahedron will be
converted to 4 hexahedra resulting in increased number of elements.

### Mesh generation with MeshGems/SALOME

*Note: This tutorial was last updated/used: June 2016*

MeshGems-Hexa is proprietary automated all-hex mesh generator.
The algorithm can be used a plug-in within the open-source platform [SALOME](https://www.salome-platform.org/). Currently, we do
not have a MeshGems-Hexa license and cannot give any support on mesh generation.
