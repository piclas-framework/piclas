The goal of PICLas is to enable to approximation of the complete Boltzmann equation:

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{x}} + \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v}} = \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\right|_{\mathrm{coll}} $$
