abstract = {The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model as well as its extensions (ellipsoidal statistical BGK, Shakhov BGK, unified BGK) are used in particle-based fluid dynamics and compared with the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method (DSMC). To this end, a method based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is presented that allows efficient sampling of the Shakhov and the unified target distribution functions. As a consequence, particle simulations based on the Shakhov BGK and the unified BGK model are possible in an efficient way. The models are validated with a Couette flow problem at different Knudsen numbers and wall velocities. Furthermore, the models are compared with DSMC results of a hypersonic flow around a 70{\$}{\^{}}\backslashcirc{\$} blunted cone. It is shown that the unified BGK model is able to reproduce rarefied gas phenomena and the Shakhov model performs better in the reproduction of shock structures compared with the ellipsoidal statistical BGK model. Additionally, a computational time study is done to show the efficiency of BGK-based simulations for low Knudsen number flows compared with DSMC. This is especially interesting for gas flows which cover a wide range of Knudsen numbers including continuum and rarefied gas regions as in nozzle expansion flows. The fact that DSMC and the utilized BGK methods are both cell local Monte-Carlo based particle methods, makes a coupling very attractive.},

abstract = {The performance of different types of boundary conditions used in direct simulation Monte Carlo models of subsonic flows for single species flow fields is assessed in this study. An inlet boundary condition that permits the specification of pressure and temperature is investigated, as well as one that permits the specification of mass flow rate and temperature. A new inlet boundary condition is suggested that permits the total mass flow rate to be specified without requiring inter-processor communication during a parallel computation. Two types of outlet boundary conditions are investigated, one in which the outlet pressure is maintained by controlling the porosity of the outlet surface, and another in which particles are introduced at the outlet with properties such that the desired pressure is maintained. Each of the boundary conditions investigated produce flow field results for a single species, microchannel flow that are in good agreement with an analytical solution of the flow field and previously reported results. However, a simulation of a more complicated multi-species flow inside a vapor deposition reactor shows that some of the predicted flow field and surface properties are a function of the type of outlet boundary condition used. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {New treatments of the subsonic constant flow rate boundary and porous outlet boundary used for the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method are proposed. For the constant flow rate boundary, the total number of molecules inserted is calculated using the number of molecules that flow out of the boundary at previous time step, and the molecules inserted over the boundary are distributed according to the local mean flow velocity and number density. For the porous outlet, it is used to simulate the vacuum pump, and the deleting probability is calculated using the number of molecules that impinge on the boundary, the local pressure and the pump speed. Except for the constant flow inlet and porous outlet, the pressure inlet/outlet and the outgassing wall boundaries are implemented in dsmcFoam and verified. The results of different treatments of the boundary are compared with each other, it shows that the new treatment of the constant flow rate boundary can achieve a more accurate flow rate, and the non-uniform distribution of the inserted molecules can decrease the averaging effect at the inlet; the porous outlet can achieve the desired pressure at the outlet when just giving the pump speed, but there is an averaging effect compared with the pressure outlet due to the uniform deleting probability. The results are also compared with that of DS2V when the boundary conditions are available, it shows that the constant pressure boundary can achieve a more accurate pressure in dsmcFoam than in DS2V, and the results of the outgassing wall are almost the same with both solvers.},

@article{Tysanner2004,
abstract = {In molecular simulations of fluid flow, the measurement of mean fluid velocity is considered to be a straightforward computation, yet there is some ambiguity in its definition. We show that in systems far from equilibrium, such as those with large temperature or velocity gradients, two commonly used definitions give slightly different results. Specifically, a bias can arise when computing the mean fluid velocity by measuring the mean particle velocity in a cell and averaging this mean over samples. We show that this bias comes from the correlation of momentum and density fluctuations in non-equilibrium fluids, obtain an analytical expression for predicting it, and discuss what system characteristics (e.g., number of particles per cell, temperature gradients) reduce or magnify the error. The bias has a physical origin so although we demonstrate it by direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) computations, the same effect will be observed with other particle-based simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics and lattice gases. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The current paper investigates the appropriateness and consequences of avoiding successively repeated collisions usually recommended in the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solvers, which use the No Time Counter (NTC) collision technique. A sensitive test case, i.e., Fourier heat transfer problem at the early slip regime, is considered in the presence and absence of the successively repeated collisions. The effects of repeated collisions and avoiding them on different parameters such as heat flux, collision frequency, collision separation distance, accepted-to-selected collisions ratio, and probability distribution functions for the number of collisions and relative velocities of collision pairs are evaluated and discussed. The investigations are performed considering contributions of different computational parameters, i.e., cell sizes, time step, and number of particles. In addition to collision frequency and collision separation distance, which were reported previously as crucial parameters affecting the accuracy of the DSMC solution, we found that the level of repeated collisions also plays a pivotal role in the accuracy of the heat flux prediction in the Fourier problem. We show that direct avoiding of repeated collisions can lead to a distortion of collision probability distribution and consequently, to introduction of a systematic error in collision frequency and predicted heat flux. This error is negligible if one uses a large number of particles per cell, but it is of considerable importance if there are a few particles per cell.},

abstract = {This article shows how to evaluate rotational symmetry numbers for different molecular configurations and how to apply them to transition state theory. In general, the symmetry number is given by the ratio of the reactant and transition state rotational symmetry numbers. However, special care is advised in the evaluation of symmetry numbers in the following situations: (i) if the reaction is symmetric, (ii) if reactants and/or transition states are chiral, (iii) if the reaction has multiple conformers for reactants and/or transition states and, (iv) if there is an internal rotation of part of the molecular system. All these four situations are treated systematically and analyzed in detail in the present article. We also include a large number of examples to clarify some complicated situations, and in the last section we discuss an example involving an achiral diasteroisomer.},

abstract = {Numerical procedures based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method are presented for determination of electronic energy distributions and gas emission in non-ionized hypersonic flows, with intended application to shock layer emission analysis for a hypersonic remote sensing platform. The proposed modeling approach enables utilization of experimental state-to-state transition rates, and differs from earlier approaches by nearly eliminating the dependence on excited state populations for statistical scatter in computed energy distributions. Calculations are performed for a simple homogeneous relaxation problem, and for a Mach 10 flow of reacting air around a blunted wedge with a global Knudsen number of 410-4. The latter flow approximately represents leading edge conditions for a hypersonic sensing platform, and results from this simulation are employed to compare gas emission with expected signal intensity along a notional signal path. We find particularly strong emission from freestream species in the region of continuum breakdown around the bow shock, and we estimate that gas emission should have a very small but potentially non-negligible influence on signal reception for a passive sensing system.},

@article{Ruscic2005,
abstract = {Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) are a good example of a significant breakthrough in chemical science that is directly enabled by the US DOE SciDAC initiative. ATcT is a new paradigm of how to obtain accurate, reliable, and internally consistent thermochemistry and overcome the limitations that are intrinsic to the traditional sequential approach to thermochemistry. The availability of high-quality consistent thermochemical values is critical in many areas of chemistry, including the development of realistic predictive models of complex chemical environments such as combustion or the atmosphere, or development and improvement of sophisticated high-fidelity electronic structure computational treatments. As opposed to the traditional sequential evolution of thermochemical values for the chemical species of interest, ATcT utilizes the Thermochemical Network (TN) approach. This approach explicitly exposes the maze of inherent interdependencies normally ignored by the conventional treatment, and allows, inter alia, a statistical analysis of the individual measurements that define the TN. The end result is the extraction of the best possible thermochemistry, based on optimal use of all the currently available knowledge, hence making conventional tabulations of thermochemical values obsolete. Moreover, ATcT offer a number of additional features that are neither present nor possible in the traditional approach. With ATcT, new knowledge can be painlessly propagated through all affected thermochemical values. ATcT also allows hypothesis testing and evaluation, as well as discovery of weak links in the TN. The latter provides pointers to new experimental or theoretical determinations that can most efficiently improve the underlying thermochemical body of knowledge.},

As opposed to traditional sequential thermochemistry, ATcT provides reliable, accurate, and internally consistent thermochemistry by utilizing the thermochemical network (TN) approach.

	abstract = {Radiation modeling is implemented in the highly parallel gas kinetic, open-source plasma simulation suite PICLas. A photon Monte Carlo approach for three-dimensional radiative energy transfer is developed. Since these kind of solvers have the disadvantage of high computational costs and statistical fluctuations, these points are addressed by specific adaptations to the solver. An approach to simulate axisymmetric problems is presented as well as noise reducing methods. Results are compared to a semi-infinite black body radiating cylinder, where an analytical solution is known, and a good agreement for both, three-dimensional and axisymmetric simulations is demonstrated. It is also shown that the implemented noise reducing methods can reduce statistical fluctuations. To calculate radiative properties in terms of emission and absorption coefficients, a line-by-line method is implemented and compared with good agreement to results obtained with other well-established radiation codes. The FIRE II reentry is used as a test case for a simulation combined with DSMC. Unidirectional coupling with the developed radiation modules shows good results compared to measured values as well as in performance scaling.}

abstract = {Observation missions of meteoroids entering the Earth’s atmosphere are conducted regularly. Meanwhile a method to replicate the flight in a ground test facilities has been established. However, numerical simulations with subsequent comparison of the spectroscopic data, on the other hand, are not yet widely used in this field. This is mainly due to the complex flow environment, which includes not only non-equilibrium radiation, but also the outgassing of species from the meteoroid that do not enter the shock since they have only the thermal velocity of the wall without macroscopic flow and therefore cannot heat up as much as the other species. This paper presents a numerical approach to replicate experimental measurements. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used and bi-directionally coupled with a radiation solver to simulate the atmospheric entry in 80km of an iron meteorite with a diameter of 38mm. The paper provides information and references on the numerical models used, the challenges encountered, and the simulation results. The study shows that the simulation models are well-suited to handle the non-equilibrium effects of meteorite entry and show good agreement with the experimental measurements.}
